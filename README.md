# molextract

A rule-based parser for Molcas/OpenMolcas log files to extract and transform any data
found in a log file.

Molextract provides a more modular approach to extracting information from log files and
abstracts out similar control flow seen in many scripts.

Molextract is abstract enough that it really isn't specific to Molcas/OpenMolcas log files.
Any file that has certain start / end markers can use the same infrastructure.
